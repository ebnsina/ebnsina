Here’s a recommended project structure for an enterprise-level app:\n\nHere’s an example of a that compares two common folder structures for a React/Next.js application: feature-based and component-based structures.\n\nWhen building a React or Next.js app, one of the most important decisions is how to organize your project’s folder structure. A well-organized codebase enhances productivity, improves scalability, and makes the app easier to maintain in the long run. In this post, we'll explore **two common folder structures** for enterprise-level apps: **Feature-Based** and **Component-Based**.\n\n## Why Folder Structure Matters\n\nA project’s folder structure defines how files are organized and how code can be reused. Especially in large-scale apps, keeping things modular and well-organized is critical. Let's dive into the two most common ways to structure a Next.js app.\n\n## Component-Based Structure\n\nA **component-based structure** groups files by their type, organizing all components, hooks, services, and contexts into separate directories. This approach is common in small to medium-sized applications.\n\n### Example Structure\n\nHere’s an example of a **component-based folder structure**:\n\n```bash\n/src\n├── /api\n│   └── /auth.js        # API services related to authentication\n│   └── /users.js       # API services related to user management\n├── /components\n│   └── /common         # Reusable UI components (buttons, modals, etc.)\n│   └── /auth           # Components related to authentication (LoginForm, SignupForm)\n│   └── /dashboard      # Components related to the dashboard\n├── /contexts\n│   └── /AuthContext.js # Context for authentication\n│   └── /ThemeContext.js # Context for theming\n├── /hooks\n│   └── /useAuth.js     # Custom hooks for authentication\n│   └── /useFetch.js    # Custom hooks for data fetching\n├── /pages              # Next.js pages (routes)\n│   └── /index.js\n│   └── /login.js\n│   └── /dashboard.js\n├── /services           # API service files\n│   └── /authService.js\n│   └── /userService.js\n└── /utils              # Utility functions (helpers, formatters, etc.)\n    └── /dateUtils.js\n    └── /storage.js\n```\n\n### Pros of Component-Based Structure\n\nClear separation of concerns: Each type of resource (components, hooks, services) has its own directory.\nEasy to find related files: If you need a particular hook or component, it’s easy to locate.\n\n### Cons of Component-Based Structure\n\nDifficult to scale: As the app grows, it can be hard to manage files related to a single feature across multiple directories.\nTight coupling: Sometimes components and hooks are tightly coupled with specific features, but this structure doesn’t group them by features, which can lead to disorganization.\n\n## Feature-Based Structure\n\nA feature-based structure organizes files by feature or module rather than by type. This approach is often more scalable for enterprise-level applications, as each feature has its own self-contained folder for components, hooks, services, and contexts.\n\nExample Structure\nHere’s an example of a feature-based folder structure:\n\n```bash\n/src\n├── /features\n│ └── /auth # Authentication feature\n│ ├── /components # Components related to authentication (LoginForm, SignupForm)\n│ ├── /hooks # Feature-specific custom hooks (useLogin, useAuth)\n│ ├── /context # Authentication context\n│ ├── /services # API services for authentication (login, signup)\n│ └── /index.js # Export all module-related files\n│ └── /dashboard # Dashboard feature\n│ ├── /components # Dashboard components (StatsCard, ActivityFeed)\n│ ├── /hooks # Feature-specific hooks (useDashboardData)\n│ └── /services # API services related to the dashboard\n├── /pages # Next.js pages\n│ └── /index.js\n│ └── /login.js\n│ └── /dashboard.js\n└── /utils # Utility functions shared across features\n└── /dateUtils.js\n```\n\nThis is how every features looks like -\n\n```bash\n/features\n├── /auth                # Authentication feature/module\n│   ├── /components      # Components related to authentication (LoginForm, SignupForm, etc.)\n│   ├── /hooks           # Feature-specific custom hooks (e.g., useAuth, useLogin)\n│   ├── /context         # Context API related to authentication\n│   ├── /services        # API services related to authentication (login, signup, etc.)\n│   ├── /types           # TypeScript types (if using TS)\n│   └── index.js         # Export module-related files (optional)\n│\n├── /dashboard           # Dashboard feature/module\n│   ├── /components      # Components related to the dashboard (StatsCard, RecentActivity, etc.)\n│   ├── /hooks           # Feature-specific hooks (e.g., useDashboardData)\n│   ├── /services        # API services related to dashboard data\n│   ├── /context         # Context API or state related to the dashboard\n│   ├── /types           # TypeScript types (if using TS)\n│   └── index.js         # Export module-related files (optional)\n│\n├── /profile             # Profile management feature/module\n│   ├── /components      # Components related to user profile (ProfileForm, AvatarUploader, etc.)\n│   ├── /hooks           # Feature-specific hooks (e.g., useProfileData)\n│   ├── /services        # API services related to user profiles\n│   └── /context         # Context API or state related to profile management\n│\n└── /products            # Products feature/module\n    ├── /components      # Components related to products (ProductCard, ProductList, etc.)\n    ├── /hooks           # Feature-specific hooks (e.g., useProductData)\n    ├── /services        # API services related to products\n    └── /context         # Context API or state related to products\n```\n\n## Key Points:\n\n- /components: Store components specific to the feature/module. These are typically not shared across other modules and are used within the scope of the specific feature.\n\n- /hooks: Feature-specific custom hooks that encapsulate logic related to the feature, like useAuth, useDashboardData, or useProfile.\n\n- /context: Context API files for managing the state related to the feature/module. For example, AuthContext for authentication or ProfileContext for profile management.\n\n- /services: API service files that handle HTTP requests for that specific feature/module. For example, authService.js for login, registration, and token handling.\n\n- /types: (Optional) TypeScript type definitions related to the feature (interfaces, types). This is optional, based on your project’s use of TypeScript.\n\n- index.js: (Optional) You can add an index.js file to export all feature-related files for easier imports when using that module elsewhere in the app.\n\n## Benefits:\n\nModular organization: Keeps feature-specific components and logic encapsulated and easily maintainable.\nSeparation of concerns: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, logic, and services.\n\nScalability: As new features or modules are added, they can follow the same structure, maintaining consistency across the codebase.\nFor shared components that are used across multiple features, keep them in the /components/common directory.\n\nThis separation ensures modularity and clean separation between feature-specific and common components.\n\nHere’s how an index.js file might look for the auth feature module:\n\n```js\n// features/auth/index.js\n\n// Export all components\nexport { default as LoginForm } from './components/LoginForm';\nexport { default as SignupForm } from './components/SignupForm';\n\n// Export custom hooks\nexport { useAuth } from './hooks/useAuth';\nexport { useLogin } from './hooks/useLogin';\n\n// Export context and provider\nexport { AuthContext, AuthProvider } from './context/AuthContext';\n\n// Export services\nexport { login, signup, logout } from './services/authService';\n\n// Export types (if using TypeScript)\nexport * from './types';\n```\n\n## How to use it:\n\nNow, instead of importing individual files like this:\n\n```js\nimport { LoginForm } from 'features/auth/components/LoginForm';\nimport { useAuth } from 'features/auth/hooks/useAuth';\nimport { AuthProvider } from 'features/auth/context/AuthContext';\nimport { login } from 'features/auth/services/authService';\n```\n\nYou can simply import them like this:\n\n```js\nimport { LoginForm, useAuth, AuthProvider, login } from 'features/auth';\n```\n\n## Benefits:\n\nCleaner imports: It reduces the amount of import clutter, especially for large feature sets.\nCentralized exports: Any changes in file paths or new exports can be handled centrally without changing imports across multiple files.\n\nScalability: As the module grows with more hooks, components, or services, they can all be added to the index.js and remain organized.\n\n### Pros of Feature-Based Structure\n\nModular and self-contained: Each feature is self-contained, with components, services, and hooks living in the same directory.\n\nScalable: It’s easier to scale and maintain large codebases, as new features can be added without disrupting the structure.\nEasier collaboration: Teams working on different features can work independently in separate feature directories.\n\n### Cons of Feature-Based Structure\n\nRedundancy: Some components or hooks might need to be duplicated if they’re needed across multiple features (though this can be mitigated by moving them to a /common or /shared folder).\n\n## Full Example\n\n```bash\n/sina-saas-app\n│\n├── /public\n│   └── favicon.ico\n│   └── /assets     #

However, as your app grows and you begin to add more features, you might find the structure harder to manage.\n\nFor large, enterprise-level applications, a feature-based structure is usually the better choice. It helps in organizing large codebases, allows for better scalability, and makes it easier for multiple teams to work on different parts of the app independently.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBoth component-based and feature-based folder structures have their own benefits and drawbacks. The best approach depends on your project’s size and complexity. For small apps, a component-based structure might suffice, but for large, enterprise-level projects, a feature-based structure is often the best way to go.\n\nHappy coding! 🎉\n";
